**SEEDS OF HAPPINESS**

All broken bits of threshing rice to workers like us,

But the complete whole grains to the sons of the rich landlords!

I was given a hen to feed eggs to his son

I was allowed free of cost to farm the barren plot of land,

I ploughed the plot and sowed the seeds of buck-wheat.

I also domesticated a buffalo for half the price,

I cultivated the land for one-third of the crops.

I feel it a pity for myself and begin to weep my heart

breaks up shedding tears from my eyes.

I work up to July and maintain food up to January,

Still, enough to eat and dress I could not provide,

Oh my God! Helpless I am to live, but I could not die!

I work day and night until the July month

Maintain the food up until the January month!

Despite so, my families are lean and thin always,

But those of the rich are strong and stout always.

Vegetables and spinach I grow up all the year

But the village chief and headmen arrive to share!

Whatever I do with all my tact and labour,

![](media/image2.jpg){width="7.136986001749781in"

exploiter!

There is no happiness at all for the sufferer!

As the stomach is empty and the body naked

How can we get seeds of pleasure and happiness?

Suggest us a gateway to enjoy it in our life!

Oh God! Let us plant a tree of happiness.

Such a thought haunts across my mental door!

I could fertilise the barren plots of land wherever available,

But what can I do as I am destined to suffer?

No rice, no millet grows up where only the due-drops fall,

The rich have everything but the poor are shunned by all.

A day certainly comes even the rich will have to die,

Will there be only troubles for poor all the ages to come?

All the broken bits of rice to workers like us,

But the complete whole grains to the sons of the rich landlords!

Will it always be so and so for all the poorer ones?
