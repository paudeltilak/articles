The topmost part of sugarecane,

The lowest part of radish;

Some examples of tasteless things

But in every field and effort

There are varieties of taste and quality

How much do we regret need to be expressed?

Servicing the guests with tobacco and water,

Before providing them the special meal;

This is I na way considered an uncivilised tradition.

Sweeping the doorsill after the crow has produced its first morning
sound,

Brushing the floor when it is getting dark,

All this is considered an evil sign

According to the religious texts!

The blossoming of peach indicates the raining season,

That of cherry indicates the winter;

But the present generations are unaware of

What our fore-father had experienced.

Voilating the natural system of Nature,

Men have harvested the paddy in july,

Instead of harvesting it in November!

Fore-father thought it better to plant banana --

\'to the north of their home sorroundings and the bamboo to the south\'.

\'The forest belongs to those who keep the buffaloes\',

\'Those who have sons are the richest ones\'

However, these days we don\'t know \'what is being right?\'

The enemies are so happy to see our deplorable plight!
