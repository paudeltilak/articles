I have been nominated by young poet dear Tilak Paudel \'SYANRKOTE' from
Nepal to post a poem every day. 

The poem will be translated into Russian and published in the alamanah
(almanac \"Fresh View\"). Each day I will nominate a poet/poetress to do
the same.

Today, I feel glad to invite (nominate) our popular Poet
'................................' from Nepal to Join and continue . He
will post his own poem for eight days. A photo is required with each
poem posted. Each poem has to be a jpeg. 

Really Very Happy to share with you all !!!
