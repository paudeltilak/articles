**Poetry Palace**

*Poet -- Prof. Dr. Yam Bahadur Kshetry*

Long, long ago!

A virgin piece of land

Baidam Pokhara was.

There stood a round house,

That Mr Pahari had built,

A \'Tauwa\' and a Cow-shed around it.

And once it got changed

Into a mansion nice to look at.

If further changes required

It would be trasnformed into

A peaceful Poetry Palace

A famous place for art and literature in Nepal.

**My Heart !**

***Poet -- Prof. Dr. Yam Bahadur Kshetry***

My heart belongs to me,

It is my mine!

But it too belongs to one,

Who wishes to belong to me,

Still that one has never been nearer and nearer to me.

This is the reason that

I wish to belong to All

Just for sharing my feelings

And Sharing others like mine!
